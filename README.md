  - [AuthProxy](./AuthBridge/AuthProxy/) - AuthProxy is a **JWT validation and token exchange proxy** for Kubernetes workloads. It enables secure service-to-service communication by intercepting and validating incoming tokens and transparently exchanging them for tokens with the correct audience for downstream services.

It automatically registers pods as Keycloak clients, eliminating the need for manual client configuration and static credentials.
